# Business Overview
B&B is a personal gift platform headquartered in Asia. It's an e-commerce platform connecting customers with local stores, providing various products for different occasions such as Vietnamese Women's Day, Halloween, birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, etc. They also offer a new search experience supported by AI, known as BB Assistant, which analyzes customer demands and finds the most suitable products. This allows customers to place orders for quality, stylish, and fast gifts anytime, anywhere.

B&B also offers a variety of gifts, including flowers, sweets, chocolates, jewelry, cosmetics, electronics, etc. Customers can choose from pre-made gift sets or customize their gifts by adding personal touches like handwritten notes, photo frames, and gift wrapping. By meeting these gifting needs, B&B becomes an online gifting platform that makes it easy to find and send unique and meaningful gifts to loved ones.

B&B aims to become a Unicorn in the online gift market in Southeast Asia (7 - 8 years ahead). However, looking at the operational results, the current revenue model still has issues as the conversion rate remains low. The main revenue comes from a commission from sellers (about 15-20% on the product value).
